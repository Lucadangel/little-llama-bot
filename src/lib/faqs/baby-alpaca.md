## Baby Alpaca – Finest Natural Material

Baby alpaca is the softest part of the adult alpaca’s coat, taken from the belly and first yearly cutting. Our knits use 100% baby alpaca, or 80% baby alpaca with 20% silk.
No synthetics—only pure, allergen-friendly, lanolin-free fibers.
Highly insulating and breathable: warmer than sheep wool, yet cool in summer.  
Natural shades, no dyes or allergy-tested dyes.
Origin: Andes mountains, sustainably grazed.
