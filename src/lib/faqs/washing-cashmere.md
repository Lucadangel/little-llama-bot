## Washing Instructions for Cashmere

Wash infrequently—airing is often enough.  
Machine wash with wool program at 30°C (in a laundry bag) or hand wash gently at 30°C.  
No fabric softener.  
Do not wring, tumble dry, or hang wet cashmere; always dry flat.  
Iron with steam (medium), towel between garment and iron.  
Lint/pilling removal: use wool comb, do gently.
Store folded with moth repellents; clean before storage.
