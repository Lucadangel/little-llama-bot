## Washing Instructions for Babyalpaca

Hand wash only, in 30°C (hand-warm) water, with constant temperature.  
Use baby alpaca-specific detergent (no lanolin, no enzymes), or organic hair shampoo.  
Do not tumble dry; air dry flat.  
Airing is usually enough for freshness.  
Baby alpaca is hypoallergenic, lanolin-free, and great for sensitive skin.
