## Sustainable Clothing Care

Wash infrequently, use eco-friendly detergents & low temperatures.
Repair, reuse, and pass on clothes (siblings, friends) to extend life.
Recycle or donate when clothes are outgrown.  
Store properly; fold, use moth repellents if needed.  
Favor natural drying, gentle care, and timeless designs.
