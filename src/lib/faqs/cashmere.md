## Cashmere – Wonderfully Soft and Warm

Harvested from capra hircus goats in Himalayan mountains, cashmere is collected when goats shed their undercoat in spring.
Famous for warmth, softness, lightness—and historically considered "king of wool fibers."
Production stages: Collection, Sorting, Depilation, Spinning, Weaving/Knitting.
Alpaca (especially baby alpaca) is a worthy luxurious counterpart.
