## Washing Instructions for Wool

Wash rarely; often just airing is sufficient.
Hand wash is best: max 30°C, plenty of water, gentle movement. No soaking, no rubbing.
Use neutral-pH, enzyme-free wool detergent.
Rinse with water at same temperature.  
Spin gently, air dry flat, never hang wet wool.
Do not tumble dry.  
For untreated/angora/mohair/alpaca: always hand wash.
